# tinkercad
For my Tinkercad Arduino project I decided to work with the tempature sensor as an input and LED bulbs as an output. I used 3 LEDs and one tempature sensor to create the simulation. My first take was to use a LED RGB but that didn't work out too well, so I settled for the LED which works perfectly. My initial proprosal was for the Arduino to sense what the temperature maybe but after working with the code, I realized that it couldn't actually sense the temperature. Turns out,using the temperture sensor is what simulates a certain temperature causing, one, two or three LEDs to light up. My take was to use blue as low temp, yellow as normal temp, and red as high temp. Clicking on the sensor and using the slider sets off each LED depending on when sliding it left of right.
